2012-06-07 1.9 Added Regions/states

    I was in charge of importing contact data, and I was wondering why the
    postal codes were prefixed by the state code in the data. It turned out
    that the user did that as a workaround because the crappy app he was using
    didn't support american states. Then I found out that he would have to use
    the same workaround in *my* crappy hack.

    As a result, Region was added. Migrations should take care of everything,
    including setting the region for cities which are already in your database.

    Another major change is that the double autocomplete is gone. Instead, we
    propose an autocomplete like google maps - which required a great
    improvement of search_names.

    We also now have a very performant implementation of alternateNames parser,
    which opens possibilities:

    - we parse postal codes
    - we know how a country/region/city is called in any language

    I hope we can find good use for that for 2.0 !

2012-05-24 1.3+ to 1.5.1

    We had to fix migration 0003 for mysql. So to upgrade from 1.3, 1.4, or 1.5
    to 1.5.1, do::

        ./manage.py migrate cities_light 0002
        pip install -U django-cities-light
        ./manage.py migrate cities_light


2012-05-19 1.0 to 1.1

    Backward compatibility breaks:
        - cities_light.widgets moved to
          cities_light.contrib.autocomplete_light_widgets,

        - cities_light.lookups moved to
          cities_light.contrib.ajax_selects_lookups,

        - cities_light.autocomplete_light_registry moved to
          cities_light.contrib.autocomplete_light_channels,

        - cities_light does not auto-register channels anymore (because you now
          have the choice between a basic channel and the remote channel.

    New features:

        - latitude and longitude fields,
        - search_names,
        - djangorestframework integration,
        - autocomplete_light+djangorestframework integration.
